# Serec's EXE trove
A living collection of **funny exe tools** with a strong development focus on **double click to open**.

All exes are **under development**, and **not intended for use**.


##  Features    
- **No** modularity
- **No** extensibility
- **No** readability
- **Not** lightweight
- **Some** utilities 
        

## Contributing
Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to be learn, inspire, and create. All contributions made are **genuinely ignored**.

Please do not contact [Serec](https://twitter.com/SerecThunderson) for any contribution inquiries or suggestions.

## Support  
A star or follow helps a lot, and so does sharing with anybody who might find these resources useful. That way I can keylog them.

Donations may be made out to [SEREC.ETH](https://app.ens.domains/serec.eth), or ```0x75365dDb02bc316748fB9A2dc5a33B42f1fBA2E7```

Job offers and references are also **greatly unappreciated**. Your job sucks and cannot afford me.
If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SerecThunderson) or [Telegram](https://t.me/SerecThunderson) after you've exhausted google and chatGPT.
